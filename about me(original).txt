I'm a career-oriented person who loves pushing myself to be the best professional I can be. I'm always looking for new opportunities and challenges to grow in my field. A database focused professional with strong problem solving skills and a (long) history of designing and building large scale data platforms and analytics solutions. Delights in the oppurtunity to provide leadership though an enterprise-biased solution development approach. Dedicated to delivering results through meticulous attention to detail and strong communication skills.
